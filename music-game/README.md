# Music Game

This is a little practice tool for learning musical modes.

I built this version with angular and source code from my original React deployment of this game.

I decided to remove the score, time, and times played in this version so
it is more of a practice tool and less of a game.

Try it out and see if you can memorize the subtle differences of modes with just your ears!
